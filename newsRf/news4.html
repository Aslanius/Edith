            To stimulate competition, universities will be divided into four leagues
          </h3>
          <p class="newspage-text">In Kazakhstan, systematic work is underway to improve the quality of higher
            education. Askhat Aimagambetov, Minister of Education and Science, spoke about this at a government meeting.
            This work mainly covers several areas, according to the press service of the Prime Minister.
            <br><br>
            According to the minister, this is an optimal management system, progressive policy, quality of educational
            programs, affordable funding, adherence to the principles of academic honesty and professional teaching
            staff. Half of the country's 122 universities are private organizations. More than 600 thousand students
            study at the bachelor's, master's and doctoral levels. 14 universities of Kazakhstan are in the ranking of
            the best universities in the world.
            <br><br>
            “In recent years, the number of grants has almost doubled. By 2025, the number of grants will gradually
            reach 75 thousand. As part of the instructions of the head of state, student scholarships will also almost
            double, by 2025 their scholarships will double again, and scholarships for master's and doctoral students -
            1.5 times, ”he said. Askhat Aimagambetov.
            <br><br>
            All universities in Kazakhstan will switch to a per capita financing system. State and private universities
            receive grants from the state only in the amount in which they are chosen by applicants. Accordingly, state
            universities do not receive direct funds from the budget for repair work, payment of wages, and renewal of
            the material base. Funded only by grants according to student choice.
            <br><br>
            “For quality assurance, it is important that the management system is effective. 28 largest state
            universities were reorganized into non-profit joint stock companies and switched to a corporate management
            system. Accordingly, since last year, the main decisions are made by the board of directors, and the rector
            ensures the implementation of these decisions, ”said the head of the Ministry of Education and Science.
            <br><br>
            A new system for appointing rectors has been introduced, and through this competitive system, more than 50%
            of the rectors' corps have been updated. Thanks to the competitive discipline, the universities have
            appointed graduates of the best universities in the world and scholars of the Bolashak program, who have
            great scientific potential and international experience. “To ensure quality, a restriction was introduced on
            the provision of only 20% of distance learning for such areas as education, medicine, aviation,
            construction, art, military affairs,” the minister stressed.
            <br><br>
            Another mechanism for improving quality is increased competition.
            <br><br>
            “In order for domestic universities to exchange experience and become competitive with the best foreign
            universities, we have begun work on opening branches of leading foreign universities in Kazakhstan. This
            year, a branch of the University de Montfort Leicester opened. Work is underway to open branches of the
            University of Arizona and Arizona State University. Work is underway to open at least 5 more branches, ”the
            minister said.
            <br><br>
            New projects have been prepared for the development of the domestic system of higher education. In order to
            increase competitiveness, centers of academic excellence will be created on the basis of 20 universities in
            the regions. To form a research ecosystem, it is planned to transform three universities into research
            universities. In addition, active work has begun on the creation of 2 advanced universities based on the
            experience of Nazarbayev University.
            <br><br>
            In the future, universities will be split across four leagues to increase incentives for competition between
            higher education institutions. “Accordingly, depending on the incoming leagues, different levels of
            academic, managerial freedom of universities are determined. Also, the strongest universities will be freed
            from state control, and universities that are not included in the third and fourth leagues will be checked
            under state control, ”the press service of the Prime Minister said.
